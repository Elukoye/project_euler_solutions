# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

def sum_1_to_num(n)
  n * (n + 1)/2
end

n = 100
sq_then_sum = 0
(1..n).each{|i| sq_then_sum += i**2}
 
diff = sum_1_to_num(n)**2 - sq_then_sum 


# formula for calculating the sum of the squares is (2n + 1)(n+1)n/6
